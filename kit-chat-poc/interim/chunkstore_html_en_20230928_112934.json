If the PO is not Manger rank or higher, please talk to OU head to ask someone to submit the creation request.\n\nRead this page for BD code details, and identify the required information of the new BD code (Budget type, Decision tree, etc.)\n\nAsk the engagement partner to confirm the information is correct.\n\nGo to KIT BD project codes page and create new item. Make sure that Status is Creation Requested.\n\nAfter the new item is successfully created, Finance team create a new BD code record in IBS system.\n\nFinance team notifies to the PO when the requested BD code is available. Use the Teams channel JP - KIT-Finance / BD Code Requests (private channel)\n\nThe new BD becomes effective after the engagement partner approves in IBS system, then Status of the list item goes to \"Active\".\n\nOptionally PO can use Charge start date filed to instruct project members from when they can start charging workhours to this BD code. Typically charge start date is the date of Start Gate event.\n\n2) How to close BD code\n\nWhen BD codes are no longer used (for instance releasing the product, end of life of the operating product), PO should close the BD code in order for project members to mischarge to unused BD codes.\n\nPO can use Charge end date filed to instruct project members until when they can charge workhours to this BD code. Typically charge end date is the date of Release Gate event.\n\nGo to KIT BD project codes page and locate the BD code to be closed. PO-filtered BD codes view helps you to show all BD codes assigned to you. Update Status to Closing Requested.\n\nFinance team notifies to the PO when the BD code is successfully closed. Use the Teams channel JP - KIT-Finance​​​​​​​ / BD Code Requests (private channel).\n\n3) How to rename/transfer existing BD code\n\nIf PO finds misinformation in KIT BD project codes, do not hesitate to contact Finance team to correct information. The situation will include\n\nThe project name is changed\n\nThe project is moved to different program\n\nPO is changed due to new assignment\n\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nBD CODE Information\n\nspo-global.kpmg.com\n\nNEW: FY22 (2021/07- )～ 1, Open/close/rename BD Code How to open BD code How to close the BD code How to rename the BD name 2, BD Code rule Rules for Requesting BD Code Decision Tree (Relationship between BD code and accounting categories) Example 1:…\n\nYou may also be interested in\n\n381 views\n\nPeople read this next\n\nKIT-INTERNAL\n\nPersonnel Changes\n\n267 views\n\nPeople read this next\n\nKIT-INTERNAL\n\n会社基本規程類　Corporate Basic Policies and Rules\n\n58 views\n\nPopular with your colleagues\n\nJP - KIT-Employee Experience\n\nKIT Language Support\n\n311 views\n\nPopular with your colleagues\n\nKIT-INTERNAL\n\nKIT Procurement Portal\n\n381 views\n\nPeople read this next\n\nKIT-INTERNAL\n\nPersonnel Changes\n\n267 views\n\nPeople read this next\n\nKIT-INTERNAL\n\n会社基本規程類　Corporate Basic Policies and Rules\n\n58 views\n\nPopular with your colleagues\n\nJP - KIT-Employee Experience\n\nKIT Language Support\n\n311 views\n\nPopular with your colleagues\n\nKIT-INTERNAL\n\nKIT Procurement Portal\n\n1 of 2\n\nLike\n\nComment\n\n410 Views\n\nSave for later\n\nComments\n\nPost",
